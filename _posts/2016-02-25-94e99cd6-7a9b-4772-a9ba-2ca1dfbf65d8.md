My affiliation with sports began before I was born and continued with annual pilgrimages to Cooperstown for the Baseball Hall of Fame Inductions.

My great grandfather Robert Stedler is considered a "founder" of the New York-Penn League. One of the league's 3 baseball divisions is named in his honor as well as the Stedler Award, given yearly to the player in the league deemed likely to go the farthest in pro baseball. He was inducted into the New York-Penn League Hall of Fame in 2013 and the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986\.
